# Software Architecture Group 8 - Final Project
## Requirements
1. (REQUIRED) – All core Observer services should be in libcore 

2. (REQUIRED) – Application specific portions of Observer should be in appropriate libraries (i.e. not libcore) 

3. REQUIRED) – Need to have a High level Session object. So application specific observers are not registered on CoreSession. 

4. (Required) – Implement a second use case for observers to show that core functionality is isolated, but can be extensible.
